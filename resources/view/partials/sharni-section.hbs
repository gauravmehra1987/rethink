			Across the board, girls & women have very few positive role models to <span>aspire to</span>, and yet there are so many inspiring examples amongst us. The <span>Australian Diamond netballers</span> are testament to this. They embody qualities worth celebrating; talent, determination, resilience, loyalty, humility, passion.
			</p>
			<p>
			<span>Weâ€™re challenging Australians</span> to re-think who we hold up as inspiration, by shining a light on our Diamonds. To stop and think about how important positive role models are in shaping society for the better. And to help us elevate role models who represent <span>brighter possibilities</span> for tomorrow.
